# Warzone
A warzone I created for MSEC. It is based off challenges all around the net. Primarily @RPISEC MBE's warzone. All credit goes to them for the setup script used. 

SETUP:
  Unzip and Import the .OVA file to virtualbox (haven't tested on VMWare sorry). 
  Networking can be set up however you want, i had it on host only for ease of use but should automatically grab a DHCP lease   if on bridged mode. 
  
TO BEGIN:
  login using the credentials level1D:level01start (level2 is the same except level02start). 
  
  
Any issues, contact me on 0x4a47@monashsec.slack.com. 

Have fun!
